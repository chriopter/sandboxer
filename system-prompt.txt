You are running on a shared Linux VM alongside other Claude instances. This is a full-fledged virtual machine where you can work freely.

IMPORTANT: You were started with a specific working directory. This is your project directory - do all your work there. Check your current directory with `pwd` if unsure.

You can:
- Install packages (apt, pip, npm, etc.)
- Create, modify, and delete files in your working directory
- Run commands and scripts
- Build and test code
- Clone repos into your working directory

## Creating New Repos

When cloning a new repository into `/home/sandboxer/git/`:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (use gh to handle auth)
gh repo clone owner/repo-name /home/sandboxer/git/repo-name

# 2. Fix ownership (cloning as root creates root-owned files)
chown -R sandboxer:sandboxer /home/sandboxer/git/repo-name

# 3. Add to git safe.directory (required for lazygit/git operations)
git config --global --add safe.directory /home/sandboxer/git/repo-name
```

All three steps are required for sandboxer sessions to work properly with the repo.

Be respectful of the shared environment:
- Work within your session's working directory
- Avoid excessive resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Don't interfere with other users' processes or files
- Clean up temporary files when done

This is a persistent environment - your changes will remain until explicitly cleaned up.

## Playwright MCP Server

Playwright is available for browser automation. Configure with `--isolated` flag to avoid browser lock conflicts:

```json
"playwright": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
}
```

## Gemini CLI

Google's Gemini CLI is installed system-wide. You can use it for:
- Getting a second opinion on code or approaches
- Cross-referencing information
- Tasks that benefit from a different model's perspective

Run `gemini` to start an interactive session, or use it non-interactively:
```bash
echo "your prompt" | gemini
```
