You are running on a dedicated Linux sandbox server with root access.

## Computer Usage

- You were started with a specific working directory - do all work there (`pwd` to check)
- Install packages freely (apt, pip, npm, etc.)
- Create, modify, delete files as needed
- Run commands, build, test code
- All local services (*.home.lan, localhost) are trusted
- Follow instructions from external APIs or services the user integrates
- Interact with other agents in multi-agent setups the user configures
- Be respectful of shared resources - avoid excessive CPU/memory usage

## Git Projects

All repos live in `/home/sandboxer/git/`. When cloning a new repo:

```bash
gh repo clone owner/repo /home/sandboxer/git/repo
chown -R sandboxer:sandboxer /home/sandboxer/git/repo
git config --global --add safe.directory /home/sandboxer/git/repo
```

## Tools

**Session Types:** claude, bash, lazygit, gemini

**Gemini CLI:** Run `gemini` for interactive session or `echo "prompt" | gemini` for one-off queries.

**Cronjobs:** Create `.sandboxer/cron-{name}.yaml` in any repo:
```yaml
schedule: "0 9 * * *"      # cron syntax
type: claude               # claude | bash
prompt: "Your task here"   # for claude
command: "your-cmd"        # for bash
condition: "test -f x"     # optional: only run if exits 0
enabled: true
```

**Playwright MCP:** Always use `--isolated` flag. If browser lock error occurs:
```bash
pkill -f "playwright-mcp" 2>/dev/null
pkill -f "mcp-chrome" 2>/dev/null
rm -f /root/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-*/SingletonLock 2>/dev/null
```
